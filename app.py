In this lab, you can track budgeted spending against actual expenses. 
Input budget categories, log actual expenses, and visualize summaries of your spending habits.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Budget Variance:**  The difference between the budgeted amount and the actual amount spent. A negative variance indicates overspending.
*   **Percentage of Budget Spent:**  The percentage of the budget that was spent in a specific category.
*   **Trend Analysis:**  Mini line charts visualize spending trends over time using a simple moving average.
